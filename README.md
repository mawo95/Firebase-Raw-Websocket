# Firebase-Raw-Websocket
Kind of the same like https://github.com/mawo95/Firebase-Bot-Madfut but everything is written with raw websockets, so no firebase lib is required to run it.


# Firestore and Real-time Database pure WebSocket wrapper
It provides 2 classes, rtdb and firestore which can be used in other projects to use firebase without any firebase lib to get a better controll about what is sent and what is received.

# Handlers
It got Listeners and Handlers like onValue.

# Set, Remove
It can set,remove and read data

And much more.
